I have installed .NET Core 3.1 and have been trying out C#.  In terms of development, it's very similar to Java, although I noticed some differences.  By default, C# variables and methods are private by default.  This is the opposite of Java where everything is public by default, so this took some getting used to.  C# also has namespaces, which makes scope management easier.  Unfortunately, most of the things I've grown to love about Kotlin seem to be absent.  There are inferred data types, however they're done a little differently and so are read-only and mutability handling.  However, the .NET Framework itself holds many advantages over the JVM.  C# has pointers and unsigned data types, for example.  Java by design does not have these because they felt like these sort of options would allow developers to accidentally introduce errors into their programs.  C# feels like a step back into the verbosity of conventional Java, calling new for new objects and the way constructors are done.  Class inheritance seems to be done very similar to Kotlin, it seems.

Overall, C# is definitely not my favorite language so far, it's pretty average.  However, the .NET Core framework is probably superior from what I've seen.
